            <h3>Unicorn, mythological animal resembling a horse.</h3>
            <p class="plum">Unicorn, mythological animal resembling a horse or a goat with a single horn on its
                forehead. The unicorn
                appeared in early Mesopotamian artworks, and it also was referred to in the ancient myths of India and
                China. The earliest description in Greek literature of a single-horned (Greek monokerōs, Latin
                unicornis)
                animal was by the historian Ctesias (c. 400 BCE), who related that the Indian wild ass was the size of a
                horse, with a white body, purple head, and blue eyes, and on its forehead was a cubit-long horn coloured
                red
                at the pointed tip, black in the middle, and white at the base. Those who drank from its horn were
                thought
                to be protected from stomach trouble, epilepsy, and poison. It was very fleet of foot and difficult to
                capture. The actual animal behind Ctesias’s description was probably the Indian rhinoceros.</p>
